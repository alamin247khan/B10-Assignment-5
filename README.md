## 📌 About This Project
"Donate Bangladesh" is an interactive web application that simulates a donation platform for various humanitarian causes in Bangladesh. Users start with a virtual balance and can donate to different causes like flood relief in Noakhali and Feni, or aid for those injured in the Quota Movement. The application tracks donation history and provides a seamless user experience with real-time balance updates.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Interactive Donation System:** Make donations to multiple causes with real-time balance updates
- **Donation History:** Track all previous donations with timestamps
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional across all device sizes
- **Modern UI:** Clean interface built with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamic content updates without page reloads
- **Educational Blog:** Informative FAQ section about DOM concepts

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **HTML5** | For semantic content structure |
| **Tailwind CSS** | For utility-first styling approach |
| **DaisyUI** | For pre-designed components and UI elements |
| **JavaScript** | For interactive functionality and DOM manipulation |
| **Git & GitHub** | For version control and code hosting |
| **Netlify** | For continuous deployment and hosting |
